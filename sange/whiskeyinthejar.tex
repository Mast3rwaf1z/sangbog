\spal2
\begin{vers}
As I was goin' over Gilgarra Mountain
I spied Colonel Farell
and his money he was countin'
First I drew my pistol
and then I drew my rapier
sayin' "Stand and deliver
for I am your bold deciever"
\end{vers}
\begin{omkvaed}
Musha ringum daram da
whack fol the daddy o
whack fol the daddy o
there's whiskey in the jar

\begin{vers}
He counted out his money
and it made a pretty penny
I put in my pocket
to take home to darlin' Jenny
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
She sighed and swore she loved me
and never would decieve me
But the devil take the women
for they always lie so easy
Musha ringum ...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
I went into me chamber
all for to take a slumber
To dream of gold and girls
and of cource it was no wonder
Me Jenny took me charges
and she fill'd them up with water
Called on Colonel Farell
to get ready for the slaughter
Musha ringum ...
\end{vers}

\begin{vers}
Next mornin' early
before I rose for travel
A-came a band of footmen
an likewise Colonel Farell
I goes to draw my pistol
for she'd stole away my rapier
But I couldn't shoot for water
so a prisoner I was taken

Musha ringum ...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
They put me into jail with
a judge all a-writin'
Robbin' Colonel Farell
on Gilgarra Mountain
But they didn't take me fists
and I knocked the jailer down
and bid a farewell 
to this tight fisted town
Musha ringum ...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
I'd like to find me brother
The one who's in the army
I don't know where he's stationed
be it Cork or in Killarney
Together we'd go roamin'
o'er the mountains of Kilkenny
And I swear he'd treat me fairer
than me darlin' sportin' Jenny
Musha ringum ...
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
There's some that takes delight
in the carriages and rollin'
Some takes delight
in the hurley or the bollin'
but I takes delight
in the juice of the barley
Courtin' pretty maids
in the mornin' oh so early
Musha ringum ...
