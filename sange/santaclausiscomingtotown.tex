\begin{sang}{Santa Claus is Coming to Town}{}
\begin{vers}
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
He's making a list
And checking it twice;
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
O! You better watch out!
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
\end{vers}

I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town!
